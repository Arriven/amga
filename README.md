# Adapive merging and pruning algorithm

Simple program to check the work of [Adapive merging and pruning algorithm] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19203888). For now it supports only the merging part of the algorythm O:)

The program created using [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and [keras-surgeon](https://github.com/BenWhetton/keras-surgeon/tree/master/src/kerassurgeon).
